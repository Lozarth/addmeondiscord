# Add me on Discord

A simple website for redirecting users to your Discord profile via your user ID

# How to use this website?

2. Then add your Discord ID to the end of this link:

3. Replace the x's with your Discord ID **(Leave the hashtag!)**

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lozarth/addmeondiscord/main/example.png)

You can use this link to redirect people to your Discord profile using your ID instead of sharing your ever-changing username and tag.

This link will send your profile to their Discord client or on mobile, to their Discord app.

Alternatively, if they do not have Discord installed on their device they can simply click on the hyperlink which leads to the web version of your profile.
